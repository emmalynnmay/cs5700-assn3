/**
 * The Invoker. It runs commands and keeps an undo/redo history — this is yours to implement.
 *
 * TODO(student): implement run / undo / redo using the two stacks below:
 *   - run:  execute the command, push it onto the undo stack, and clear the redo stack
 *   - undo: pop the last command, call undo() on it, and push it onto the redo stack
 *   - redo: pop from the redo stack, re-execute it, and push it back onto the undo stack
 *
 * Until you implement these, performing a command (from a button or a program) does nothing.
